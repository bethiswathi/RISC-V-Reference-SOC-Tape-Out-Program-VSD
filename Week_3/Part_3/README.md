- Clone the OpenSTA repository by executing the following command
`````
git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenSTA.git
`````
- Move into the OpenSTA directory that was created during cloning process using the following command
`````
cd OpenSTA
`````

- Create a build directory using the following command
`````
mkdir build
`````

- Move into the build directory using the following command
`````
cd build
`````

- Configure the build be executing the following command
`````
cmake ..
`````
This command configures the build process for OpenSTA, generating the necessary build files based on the project's configuration.<br><br>

- Move to the home directory using the following command
`````
cd 
`````

- Install the eigen using the following command
````
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
````
- Again move to the build directory in OpenSTA and configure the build by executing the following command

If the above error occured then you have to install CUDD
- Move to your home directory and clone the CUDD repository by executing the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/ivmai/cudd.git
```
- And you have to install these 2 dependencies by following commands
```
sudo apt-get install automake
sudo apt-get install autoconf m4 perl
```
- Then move into the directory cudd by typing the command
```
cd cudd
```
- After that run the following commands to configure CUDD
```
autoreconf -i
```

- Create a build directory using the following command
```
mkdir build
```

- Move into the build directory using the following command
```
cd build
./configure --prefix=$HOME/cudd
```

- Build CUDD by running the following command
```
make
```

- Install CUDD by executing the following command
```
make install
```

Now CUDD is installed successfully
- Move into the OpenSTA directory that was created during cloning process using the following command
```
cd OpenSTA
```
- Move into the build directory using the following command in the OpenSTA
```
cd build
```

- Configure the build by executing the following command
```
cmake .. -DUSE_CUDD=ON -DCUDD_DIR=$HOME/cudd
